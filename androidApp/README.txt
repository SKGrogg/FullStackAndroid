This app was written in Android Studio in Kotlin, and meant to be run on a Pixel 2 emulator running on API 29.

All minimal requirements for the app are present. Additionally, I have added two other features. The first ensures a safe search by the user, only accepting inputs between the years 1955 and 2022 as to stay within the confines of the API. Secondly, on the detail screen, the user can click an information button on the top bar to initiate a google search about the movie.
